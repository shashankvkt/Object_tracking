# Object_tracking
Vision based object tracking and following uses the technique of visual servoing using a camera mounted on a 3-axis Gimbal.  
Unlike using a fixed camera, using a 3-axis gimbal adds better solution for object tracking and following as the camera can always focus on the target keeping it within the frame.  
This project involves the technique where the target is always kept at the centre of the frame of reference and the camera mounted on the Gimbal tracks the target with an attempt to keep it at the centre and then follows the target keeping it within its proximity. 

1. Select the target on the web app - flytgimbal as shown in the picture below

2. Once the target is selected run the code..you should see that the camera mounted on the gimbal tracks the target continously as shown below
